# Booking Hotel - Servlet + JSP + Tailwind

## Case Study

A longtime shop specializing in figures is called Tetcha. This store has a full range of models and accessories on display. The business situation is not very positive with the current epidemic, the shop owner has decided to develop a web application to be able to manage and sell online. This web application needs to include an item management system and a customer ordering system.

Some rules that this web application needs to follow:

People can view the items, put products in the cart, but only authenticated users (registered accounts) can order and pay. Manager capabilities and client capabilities must be separate. Specifically, the customer, the authenticated user, can order and pay for the product, and at the same time can edit the order such as correct the quantity or delete the order in some special situations, and review the purchase history. your goods. Manager capabilities include adding products, updating product information, viewing customer order details, and canceling or confirming orders.
